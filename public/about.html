<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Ross Kennedy, a 29-year-old tech enthusiast from the Emerald Isle, Ireland. 
  I'm on an exciting journey to become a web developer, ready to craft digital wonders that make the web a better place for everyone.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in coding, you might find me exploring the scenic beauty of Ireland, enjoying a good book, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I love combining creativity with technology and am always eager to learn new skills and take on challenges.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
